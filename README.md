# Bank 1 Project:

The Bank Project is a console application created using C++ that incorporates several fundamental programming concepts such as structures, enums, vectors, and file handling. This project aims to provide a simple and efficient way to manage a list of clients for a bank.

## Concepts Used

The following programming concepts are utilized in this project:

- **Structure**: Structure is used to define the client data structure, allowing for the organization of client information into a single entity.

- **Enum**: Enums are used to define constants like menu options, making the code more readable and maintainable.

- **Vector**: Vectors are employed to store and manage the list of clients.

- **Dealing with Files**: The project involves reading from and writing to files. File used in this project is "clients-list.txt".

## Functionalities

The Bank Project offers the following functionalities:

1. **Show Client List**: This option displays all clients stored in the "clients-list.txt" file in the form of a table. The table includes Account Number, PIN Code, Name, Phone, and Balance columns.

2. **Add New Clients**: Users can input client information, and the program saves it to the "clients-list.txt" file.

3. **Delete Client**: Users can specify an Account Number, and the program will delete the client with that specific Account Number from the list.

4. **Update Client**: Users can specify an Account Number, and the program will allow them to update the client's information associated with that Account Number.

5. **Find Client**: Users can input an Account Number, and the program will display the client's information in a user-friendly format.

6. **Exit**: The program can be gracefully terminated by entering the number 6.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Khadijarejjaoui99/bank-project-1.git

   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd bank-project-1
   ```
3. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./main

   ```

Upon launching the application, you will be presented with a menu of options corresponding to the functionalities described above. Follow the prompts and select the desired action to manage the list of clients efficiently.
